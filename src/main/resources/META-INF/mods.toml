incobalt's Roleplay Chat
    A chat modification that facilitates RL/roleplaying play. Largely features distance-based chat to keep chat localized to an area. Adds commands to simulate raising (/shout) and lowering (/whisper) your voice, and an admin command to send a message to everyone on the server (/broadcast). Chat color codes are also implemented with &, but this is restricted to a configurable permission level.
    Also included is a missive system that replaces Minecraft's /msg command. Missives greatly restrict long-range messaging to a time-based system that optionally uses resources.
    incobalt's Roleplay Chat was inspired by a streamed roleplay Spigot server experience that could not be replicated by existing Forge mods. It is heavily commented to serve as a learning resource!
    As a note: This mod can be deployed server side only and works with both vanilla and Forge clients when doing so. Commands and chat symbols work perfectly from the server. If you deploy server side only and want to use Missive items, you need to configure the mod to use server-side item checking (in the Missive section).
