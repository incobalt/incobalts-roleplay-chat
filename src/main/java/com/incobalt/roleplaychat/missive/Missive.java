/*
    Missive System
    The Missive System is an overhaul to the standard /msg command that sends messages over time, rather than instantly,
    to give the impression of sending something out into the world that needs to be delivered. The amount of time it takes
    for a missive to arrive at its destination depends on how far away the sender and receiver are. It travels an amount
    of blocks in an amount of seconds (both set in the config, default is 100 blocks in 3 seconds).

    Missives can optionally use items. A missive might use up a consumable item (defined in the config). Consumables
    always check held items before checking the inventory. A missive might also use a held catalyst, which is an item
    that doesn't get used up but allows the player to send a message. Catalysts are checked before consumables. Both are
    optional in the config.

    Missives are complicated and require server/client packets to function with items. If items and commands aren't used,
    then they can operate on the server side alone.
